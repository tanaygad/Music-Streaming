README

We havent named the files accordingly as the pdf suggests .
We have 1 home1.html website which has a link to home2.html (button=right slide image on the floater element)
home1.html has a navbar which links to artists.html and about.html.
the present working file is indicated by white text instead of black
the sidebar has a working top charts button and artists button
the top charts button opens a drop down menu which when individually clicked might lead to link to the artists section of teh same page
the above is applicable only in home1,2 .
all the other pages have been linked exactly as asked for
The entire website requires an active net connection to run in proper

Apologies for faulty naming and punctuations
