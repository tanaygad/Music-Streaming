We have assumed that the final file will not be resized or minimized while checking the website
We assumed that there will be more features later in the course of the project that would involve creating accounts for users 
based on which many other personalized features are also present
If required , these can be removed immediately
We also assume that javascript would be used later in the project to support the website which would help in adding some 
features which we initially intended to like the drop down menu in the sidebar  which was supposed to not overlap the underlying 
buttons
We also assumed that the initial floater containiing ads and posters for now would later be implemented in the form of a gallery picture viewer
for now different files have been created for every single image(2) of that floater element.
We have provided minimum info on most  of the artist pages without elaborating further (providing extra info).
For song albums having more than 5 songs we have only noted down 5 of them and the no of songs written on the 
albums page has been written only as 5 to maintain consistency with the song page
We have not followed the naming constrains set by the instructions pdf .



The radio buttons added have been made in shape of a star by making display prop of the radiobutton to none
The search  page has been linked in the home page on both the nav bar and search bar
The spotlight page has been linked in the homepage in the sidebar only
The typing effect has been used for artist name in the individual artists page
